Created by Brody Stewart. Simple library management system for Software Development I 202620 , Module 3 Assignment 2.
Made on February 4th, 2026.

The LMS (Library Management System) is designed to store basic patron information of a local library. It stores the patron's name, address and unpaid fines. 
These patrons are saved to an array as objects containing said information, meaning nothing is truly stored.
Each patron is also assigned an ID by the program, making it easier to find their specific information when searching for their ID.
The user interacts with the program via the terminal. They can add a patron manually or by text file. 
They can remove a patron by their ID. They can search for a patron's specific information by ID or name.
If they search by name, it will list the information of every patron with the same name.
Finally, the user can display all patron information in the system.

Below is the text file and other formatting rules:
 * This text file can hold multiple patrons.
 * It must be formatted as "FirstName LastName-Address-Fines", separated by line for each patron.
 * Name field should always follow the FirstName LastName format and be above 2 characters.
 * Address field should be between 5 and 100 characters.
 * Fine field should be between 0 and 250 dollars

This repository includes the source code and a zip file, containing the ability to run it without the code.
It includes a compiled JAR of the program, a text file that comes with pre-made patron information for testing, a read-me, and a batch file to run the program with.
